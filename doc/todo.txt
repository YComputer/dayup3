改为production环境后还遗留两个问题
bundle.js:1 Warning: It looks like you're using a minified copy of the development build of React. When deploying React apps to production, make sure to use the production build which skips development warnings and is faster. See https://fb.me/react-minification for more details.e @ bundle.js:1o @ bundle.js:1(anonymous function) @ bundle.js:36(anonymous function) @ bundle.js:36t @ bundle.js:1(anonymous function) @ bundle.js:34t @ bundle.js:1(anonymous function) @ bundle.js:1t @ bundle.js:1(anonymous function) @ bundle.js:1(anonymous function) @ bundle.js:1
bundle.js:31 You are currently using minified code outside of NODE_ENV === 'production'. This means that you are running a slower development build of Redux. You can use loose-envify (https://github.com/zertosh/loose-envify) for browserify or DefinePlugin for webpack (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30030031) to ensure you have the correct code for your production build.

这两个问题先留着吧。
